****
The DataMatrix is the return structure of data access calls and the input of data modify calls.
It is just a table with rows and lines. Each row has the same number of lines.
Think of it like an return table of an SQL command. In addition it has the capabilities to store 
vectors in the cells and there is even a row of type DT_UNKOWN.

TIP: The DataMatrix is the central element to read and write data (meta/bulk). It is important to be familiar with it.
