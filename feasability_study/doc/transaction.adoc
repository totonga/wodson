== Transaction

****
Changing model or data(meta/bulk) will automatically open an transaction. This need to be aborted or committed. There is only one transaction level to be used.

NOTE: Because the physical storage of an ASAM ODS server is a relational database we need transaction handling

IMPORTANT: Try to do all changes in a single transaction. 
           Might be hard because you have to care about the 
           right sequence of write operations or bundle them 
           in one call but you get an rollback as a reward
